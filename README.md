# Analysis of Chip Huyen's "llama-police" collection

In her blogpost, ["Building A Generative AI Platform"](https://huyenchip.com//2024/07/25/genai-platform.html),  Chip Huyen describes an idealized GenAI-driven application.  She later compiled a [large list](https://huyenchip.com/llama-police.html) (1,000+) of projects available in github that have to do with building such applications.  Here, I'm going over that list to understand her classification, and cannibalize it to build an "LLM Stack" landscape.
